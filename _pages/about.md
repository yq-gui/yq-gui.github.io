Hi there! I am Yuqian Gui (桂雨谦), currently a **first-year PhD** student in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tsinghua University. I received my B.S. in Physics in Zhili College, Tsinghua University in June, 2024. You can find [my CV here](/files/CV.pdf).

My current research interest is how does the **evolution of galaxies** associated with **their merger histories and large-scale structure environments**.

My recent research is about different evolutionary tracks of different galaixes in view of the angular momentum of CGM around them. Specifically, under the guidence of [Prof. Dandan Xu](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~dxu/), I am working on understanding episodic star formation histories of star-forming galaxies, and trying to figure out the origin of the diversity of their properties. This work is based on [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org) simulation.

Before focusing on the wonderful mysteries of galaxies, my primary work is about statistical analyses of microlensing planets using [KMTNet](https://kmtnet.kasi.re.kr/kmtnet-eng/) data, supervised by [Prof. Shude Mao](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/). You can check [Publications](https://yq-gui.github.io/publications/) to get the details.

Besides, I am also curious about machine learning and AI for science, since I believe they can really help us better understand our universe and the hidden physics! I am not quite familiar with them now, but will try my best to keep studying.
