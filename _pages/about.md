Hi there! I am Yuqian Gui (桂雨谦), currently a **first-year PhD** student in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tsinghua University. You can find [my CV here](/files/CV.pdf).

My current research interest is how does the **evolution of galaxies** associated with **their merger histories and large-scale structure environments**. Also, I am curious in cosmology  

My recent research is about different evolution tracks of different galaixes in view of the angular momentum of CGM around them. Specifically, under the guidence of [Prof. Dandan Xu](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~dxu/), I am working on understanding episodic star formation histories of star-forming galaxies, and trying to figure out the origin of the diversity of their properties. This work is based on [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org) simulation.

Hobbies and Personal Life
