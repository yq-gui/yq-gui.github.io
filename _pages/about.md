Hi there! I am Yuqian Gui (桂雨谦), currently a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). I received my B.S. in Physics in [Zhili College](https://www.zlc.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in June, 2024.

My current research interest is how does the **evolution of galaxies** associated with **their merger histories and large-scale structure environments**.

My recent research is about different evolutionary tracks of different galaixes in view of the angular momentum of CGM around them. Specifically, under the guidence of [Prof. Dandan Xu](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~dxu/), I am working on understanding episodic star formation histories of star-forming galaxies, and trying to explain the origin of the scatter in star foramtion main sequence with their evolutionary stages. This work is based on [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org) simulation.

Before focusing on the wonderful mysteries of galaxies, my primary work is about statistical analyses of microlensing planets using [KMTNet](https://kmtnet.kasi.re.kr/kmtnet-eng/) data, supervised by [Prof. Shude Mao](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/). We use [KMTNet telescope](https://kmtnet.kasi.re.kr/kmtnet-eng/) to find the microlensing planets. This method is first proposed by Prof. Shude Mao and his supervisor in 1991 ([Paper link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...374L..37M/abstract)). We worked in “Mass-Production for KMTNet AnomalyFinder Planets” project which analyzes 2016-2019 microlensing events. I have finished the analysis of half of the 2017 events and published a paper. You can check [Publications](https://yq-gui.github.io/publications/) to get the details.

Besides, I am also curious about machine learning and AI for science. I believe they can really help us better understand our universe and the physics we don't know! I am not quite familiar with them now, but will try my best to keep studying.
