We report the analysis of four unambiguous planets and one possible planet from the subprime fields (Γ ≤ 1 hr^-1) of the 2017 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) microlensing survey, to complete the KMTNet AnomalyFinder planetary sample for the 2017 subprime fields. They are KMT-2017-BLG-0849, KMT-2017-BLG-1057, OGLE-2017-BLG-0364, and KMT-2017-BLG-2331 (unambiguous), as well as KMT-2017-BLG-0958 (possible). For the four unambiguous planets, the mean planet–host mass ratios, q, are (1.0, 1.2, 4.6, 13) × 10^-4, the median planetary masses are (6.4, 24, 76, 171) M⊕, and the median host masses are (0.19, 0.57, 0.49, 0.40) M⊙, respectively, found from a Bayesian analysis. We have completed the Anomaly Finder planetary sample from the first 4 yr of KMTNet data (2016–2019), with 112 unambiguous planets in total, which nearly tripled the microlensing planetary sample. The "sub-Saturn desert" (log q=[-3.6,-3.0]) found in the 2018 and 2019 KMTNet samples is confirmed by the 2016 and 2017 KMTNet samples.
